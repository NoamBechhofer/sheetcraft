Wrapper library for xlsx prioritizing ergonomics

## vision

The impetus behind this library is to make spreadsheet manipulation easy and dev
friendly. As of this writing, the only mature and well-maintained library for
xlsx manipulation in the npm ecosystem is xlsx, aka SheetJS. While SheetJS is
doing wonderful work, using it feels more like programming C than js. Every step
involves low level legwork, and most operations require you a write-it-yourself
approach. I envision a library that feels like graphical spreadsheet software:
well-defined and intuitive high level operations that flow naturally.
